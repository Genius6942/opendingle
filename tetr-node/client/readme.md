# Crimson.js

A Node.js library for tetr.​io and ch.​tetr.​io, asynchronous and typed (well, mostly)

> **Warning**
>
> this library is still in heavy development. although useable, very fragile.  
> tetr.io is still in alpha, any new updates to the game have a chance to break the library if it goes unnoticed.  
> use an authorized bot account if you're trying to connect to the gateway or interact with the main game api!

## Module Exports

- `Client` the main guy
- `api` wrapper around the rest api
  - `channel` tetra channel
  - `game` main game
- `CONSTANTS` bunch of enum-dictionary-like helper object
- `Types` bonus, typings for stuff like ribbon messaging, room config schema, etc

## Current Example

```ts
// test.ts - connect to gateway
import { Client, CONSTANTS } from "crimson.js";

const session = new Client("<token>");

session.events.on(CONSTANTS.EVENTS_TYPES.SESSION_READY, (endpoint) => {
  console.log("ready!");
  console.log(`connected to ${endpoint} as ${client.user.username}`);
});

session.login();
```

## Building

- `λ npm install --production=false` locally install the dependencies, ts, tsup, and other dev dependencies
- `λ tsc` and emits the transpiled codes to `./out/`
- `λ npx run bundle` and emits the bundled cjs, esm, and dts codes to `./dist/`
- `λ npx run docs` to build the auto-generated docs and emits it to `./docs/`
- `λ npx install -S` in a testing directory with `"crimson.js": "file:<lib dir rel path>"` in `package.json` dependencies field
